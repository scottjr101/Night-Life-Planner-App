## ABOUT THE APP
This app is all about helping the user decide what to do with their evening. So to get started they need to select "Events", "Movies"
, or "Food/Drinks" from the navigation bar at the top of the page. Once they have filled out the required fields and submitted the 
information, they need to scroll down to the bottom of the page to view their results. The Events page comes back with results from 
the `Ticket Master` API. The Movies page shows us results from `Fandango` with the help of the `Gracenote` API. Finally, the 
Food/Drinks page shows us results from the `Zomato` API.
